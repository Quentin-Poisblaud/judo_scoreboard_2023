# judo scoreboard 2023

This project is a judo scoreboard based on the 2023 French rules (including Kinsa and 3 Shidos).

When the application is opened, two windows appear: 
- One with the scoreboard
- The other with the points management interface

If a window with `Merci de recharger la page` is displayed, close all scoreboard windows and reload this page.

In addition to being able to modify the score, penalties and stopwatch, it is also possible to modify the name and club of the two current fighters, as well as those of the next fight. It is also possible to modify the competition information displayed.
